# Credit-Risk
Credit risk assessment has a great significance in management activity, such as lending money to those who are in need for it.
The most important and frequent challenge for the banks has to make a decision for approval or rejection of loan.
The main aim is to classify the customers into one of the finite class.
The evaluation of credit risk datasets leads to the judgement to issue or not.
With the help of Deep Learning, the proposed work solves this issue by using the random forest and logistic regression model.
The process of prediction starts from cleaning and processing of data, imputation of missing values, experimental analysis of data set and testing the test data to predict the target result. 
The Logistic regression and Random forest models are used to predict that the client is potential to repay the loan or not with the accuracy of 98 % and100 % respectively.
This model is used for the banking system or anyone who wants to apply for a loan.
From the analysis of the data, it is very clear that it reduces all the frauds done at the time of loan approval.
